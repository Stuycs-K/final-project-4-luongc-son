# Work Log

## 5/17/2023
 - Starting research on Hill Cipher, finding resources and links, getting the raw data down in the presentation file, will make it look better later (Nelson and Cyrus)
 - We expect for the research phase to last for the week

## 5/18/2023
 - See yesterday (Nelson and Cyrus)
 - Made an initial plan for the lesson, will make changes later (Nelson and Cyrus)
 - Researching potential ideas for project beyond encryption/decryption- possibly use Hill Cipher for Image Encryption? (Cyrus)

## 5/19/2023
 - Starting to write up the presentation, will begin with the General Notes section, will refine later (Nelson)
 - Starting to write up the ReadMe (Cyrus)
 - Discussed concerns regarding the Image Encryption, talked about how it should be executed, seems to be resolved (Nelson and Cyrus)

## 5/21/2023
 - Added vulnerabilities notes to presentation (Nelson)

## 5/22/2023
 - Updated presentation.md file to include specifics on how the cipher works (Nelson and Cyrus)
 - Figured out means of presentation in regards to demonstration of cipher (Nelson and Cyrus)
 - Created Hill Cipher encryption and decryption files in Processing (Cyrus)
 - Pushed starting code (Nelson)

## 5/23/2023
- Further progress on encryption code, mostly user input (Nelson and Cyrus)

## 5/24/2023
 - Finishing up user input, starting on the encryption process itself (Nelson and Cyrus)

## 5/25/2023
 - Working on encryption process, discussing how to implement it, trying to figure out algorithm (Nelson and Cyrus)

# Work Log

## 5/17/2023
 - Starting research on Hill Cipher, finding resources and links, getting the raw data down in the presentation file, will make it look better later (Nelson and Cyrus)
 - We expect for the research phase to last for the week

## 5/18/2023
 - See yesterday (Nelson and Cyrus)
 - Made an initial plan for the lesson, will make changes later (Nelson and Cyrus)
 - Researching potential ideas for project beyond encryption/decryption- possibly use Hill Cipher for Image Encryption? (Cyrus)

## 5/19/2023
 - Starting to write up the presentation, will begin with the General Notes section, will refine later (Nelson)
 - Starting to write up the ReadMe (Cyrus)
 - Discussed concerns regarding the Image Encryption, talked about how it should be executed, seems to be resolved (Nelson and Cyrus)

## 5/21/2023
 - Added vulnerabilities notes to presentation (Nelson)

## 5/22/2023
 - Updated presentation.md file to include specifics on how the cipher works (Nelson and Cyrus)
 - Figured out means of presentation in regards to demonstration of cipher (Nelson and Cyrus)
 - Created Hill Cipher encryption and decryption files in Processing (Cyrus)
 - Pushed starting code (Nelson)

## 5/23/2023
- Further progress on encryption code, mostly user input (Nelson and Cyrus)

## 5/24/2023
 - Finishing up user input, starting on the encryption process itself (Nelson and Cyrus)

## 5/25/2023
 - Working on encryption process, discussing how to implement it, trying to figure out algorithm (Nelson and Cyrus)
 - Pushed starter code, will need to redo later (we both did it on Cyrus' computer since it would be easier) (Nelson and Cyrus)
 - Got the encryption code working (minimum viable product) (Nelson)
 - Running tests (Cyrus)

## 5/26/2023
 - Fixing errors on key generation (Nelson + Cyrus)
 - Researching how to find discriminant of an n x n matrix (Nelson + Cyrus)
 - Discriminant code, coprime code, and finalized key code (Nelson)
 - Extensive testing, verifying that it works (Cyrus)

## 5/27/2023
 - Pushed starter code for hillDecrypt, did user input (Nelson)

## 5/28/2023
 - Created imgEncrypt file, working on user input (Cyrus)

## 5/29/2023
 - Created framework for imgEncrypt file (Cyrus)

## 5/30/2023
 - Completed imgEncrypt (Cyrus)
 - Wrote the helper functions for hillDecrypt's algorithm, researching Processing libraries, learning how to use Pallav.Matrix (Nelson)

## 5/31/2023
 - Edited presentation.md file (Cyrus)
 - Pushed temporary code for hillDecrypt, will need to fix issue regarding a function provided by the new library (Nelson)

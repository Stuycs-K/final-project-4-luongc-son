Initial Plan
 - start off with brief introduction regarding history of Hill Cipher (when it was invented)
 - describe what it is and mention the vulnerabilities
 - demonstrate the math
 - show an example with the code (image encryption)

## Notes
 - Hill Cipher follows a polygraphic substitution cipher, which means there is uniform substitution across multiple levels of blocks.
 - More mathematical cipher compared to other ciphers: based on linear algebra, heavily relies on the sophisticated use of matrices
   - Mostly matrix multiplication and matrix inverses
 -

- Our presentation will consist of:
  - A brief background on the invention of the Hill Cipher
  - General overview of how it works using matrices to encrypt and decrypt messages
  - Benefits and features, as well as weaknesses of the Hill Cipher 
- We are working to make a Java program in Processing that is able to encrypt/decrypt the Hill Cipher. (Minimum Viable Project)
- We also want to create an Image Encryption/Decryption program in Processing that utilizes the Hill Cipher in its encryption/decryption process.

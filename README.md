# Hill Yeah!
## Nelson So and Cyrus Luong, Period 4

### Project Description
- Our presentation will consist of:
  - A brief background on the invention of the Hill Cipher
  - A general overview of how it works using matrices to encrypt and decrypt messages
    - This will involve a demonstration using matrices, probably on the whiteboard 
- We are working to make a Java program in Processing that is able to encrypt/decrypt the Hill Cipher. (Minimum Viable Project)
- We also want to create an Image Encryption/Decryption program in Processing that utilizes the Hill Cipher as an extra.

### Instructions
 - Using the tools will require you to have Processing 4.0 installed
 - Further instructions will be printed by the program
   - It's advised that you utilize the encryption tool to produce the inputs for the decryption tool. Don't try to make up your own keys.
   - Notice: The decryption tool might say "This is not a valid character!" when you press Enter for the ciphertext. Don't fret; this is simply because the "enter" key for the next input (the key) is the "1" key rather than Enter, hence the Enter is not used and therefore "not valid".
